The master for these figures is the file oo-figures.sxd.

The individual PDFs are generated by loading that file in OpenOffice,
selecting the components that make up a single figure, hitting "File
-> Export as PDF", choosing the filename correponding to the figure
selected, hitting "Export", and then in the second dialog box that
pops up, hitting "Range: Selection", and then "Export" again.  Make
sure to use lossless compression.

Then you get a pdf file that's the size of a whole page, with the
actual figure floating somewhere in the middle.  This is where the
pdfcrop.pl script comes in.  Run 'pdfcrop.pl <your file>.pdf'; this
will generate <your file>-crop.pdf'.  Copy that over <your file>, and
you should be good on the PDF.

The PNGs are exported in the same way from OpenOffice: select the
figure, export.. and change the file type to PNG and the output file
name as appropriate.  There equivalent prompt for Selection is a
checkbox at the bottom of the first dialog this time, and will be on
by default if a selection is active.
