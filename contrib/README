This directory contains various things that we're not quite sure what

  -- Log2Gxl.java: Java code to convert output from 'monotone log' into
     GXL, an XML-based graph description language.

  -- Notify.pl: a Perl hack to create email logs with recent changes
     in a repository database.  It's designed to be run at regular
     intervals, for example from a cron script.  It uses database
     variables (those handled with 'monotone set/unset') in the domain
     domain 'notify' to keep track of the last revisions that have
     already been sent out.
