# If the sink has more epochs than the source (say, on branches that are
# included in the include glob, but only exist on the sink), then the epoch
# refiner on the source will say we have items to receive. But since we're in
# source-only mode, we won't actually be receiving any items. So our epoch
# refiner will forever say we have items to receive, and we don't want to hang
# forever waiting for them.

# FIXME: This test will HANG on failure. (And then, of course, it will report
# "ok" if stopped with ^C, since the stuff to check that the push worked
# doesn't actually get run... :-/ )
