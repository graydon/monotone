        0.25 release.

        ipv6 now supported.
        revert now requires an argument.
        'revert' gives feedback while running

        0.24 release.

        Configuration change (Windows only):
        - Configuration directory on Windows has changed.  It used to
          be some complicated and varying function of %HOME%,
          %USERPROFILE%, %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%, whether you were
          running in mingw/cygwin, etc.  It is now, always,
          %APPDATA%\monotone.  For instance, if your configuration
          file used to be named
           ...\Documents and Settings\user\.monotone\monotonerc
          it will now be named
           ...\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\monotone\monotonerc
          Please rename files appropriately.

        Major key management changes:
        - Private keys are no longer stored in your database.  They
          are stored in ~/.monotone/keys/ (Unix, OS X) or
          %APPDATA%\monotone\keys\ (Windows).  'db migrate' will
          automatically move your keys out of your database and into
          their proper location.  Consequences:
          - 'genkey' no longer requires a database.  Simply run it
            once when you first start using monotone, even before you
            have created a database.
          - Running 'genkey' once will suffice to give all databases
            on one computer access to your key.  No more fiddling with
            'read'.
          - When you want to make your key available on another
            computer, simply copy over the appropriate file from your
            'keys' directory to the corresponding directory on the new
            computer.
        - Private keys also use a more standard on-disk envelope
          encoding ("PBE-PKCS5v20(SHA-1,TripleDES/CBC)") instead of
          previous ARC4.  More secure, and with extra crypto karma.

        Netsync changes:
        - Command line syntax for 'serve' changed; administrators WILL
          have to adjust scripts.
            monotone serve my.host.com "*"
          becomes
            monotone serve --bind=my.host.com "*"
          or simply
            monotone serve "*"
          (to serve on the default port, on all interfaces).
        - Speaking of which, we can now bind to all interfaces; run
          'serve' without passing --bind, or with passing
          --bind=:port, and monotone will listen on all interfaces.
        - New option '--key-to-push' for 'push', 'sync', allows
          administrator to push a new user's public key into a running
          server without restarting it.
        - Netsync permission hooks have new defaults that read a
          description of allowed access out of a standard,
          basic_io-based textfile (the same stanza-based format that
          revisions use).  Current hooks will continue to work, but
          users may prefer to transition to this format; see manual
          for details.
        - Between these, it is now straightforward to change
          permissions and add users without restarting your server.
        - Improvements to experimental "usher" facility.

        UI improvements:
        - New convenience options "add --unknown", "drop --missing",
          "revert --missing" do what you'd expect -- add all
          non-ignored non-versioned files, drop all
          deleted-but-undropped files, and restore all
          deleted-but-undropped files, respectively.
        - New selector "h:" to select heads of a branch.  "h:" means
          heads of current branch, "h:mybranch" means heads of
          mybranch.
        - Similarly, "b:" selector with no argument now refers to
          current branch.
        - Commit messages now have a blank line at the top so you can
          start typing directly.
        - No more obscure error messages when multiple monotone
          processes attempt to access a single database at the same
          time; we now fail early with a more sensible error message.
          (Concurrent access has never caused database corruption;
          this simply makes the corruption prevention less frustrating
          for the user.)
        - New handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT to rollback database
          transactions.  Not visible to users (unless you're really
          looking carefully).  (Again, killing monotone has never been
          able to cause database corruption; this simply causes the
          transactions to be rolled back immediately, rather than the
          next time monotone runs, which improves robustness in some
          theoretical way.)

        Changes in 'automate':
        - New command 'automate keys' to get information on existing
          keys in basic_io format.

        Updated translations:
        - fr

        Smaller changes:
        - Improved handling of multibyte characters in message
          displays.
        - Fixes to Botan's memory allocator, to avoid pathological
          slowdowns in some rare cases.
        - Fix bug in delta-storage code; we were not being as aggressive
          about delta-compressing files and manifests as we should
          have been.
        - Minor bugs fixed, error messages improved.

                - Upgrading from 0.23: You must run 'db migrate' and
                  provide your password, for each database.

Fri Sep 30 02:50:05 PDT 2005

        0.23 release.

        Possibly incompatible changes:
        - hook_note_commit and hook_note_netsync_revision_received
          take a new argument containing the text of the revision that
          was received.  (Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>)
        - 'cat FILENAME' now acts like the old 'cat file REV
          FILENAME'; use new commands 'automate get_revision',
          'automate get_manifest', 'automate get_file' to fetch
          objects by hash.  (Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>)

        General improvements:
        - .mt-ignore support (Martin Dvorak
          <jezek2@advel.cz>, Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>)
        - much work on making monotone more i18n friendly (Benoît
          Dejean <benoit@placenet.org>, Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>)
        - support for more interactive merge tools:
          - FileMerge.app (comes with OS X) (Marcel van der Boom
            <marcel@hsdev.com>)
          - TortoiseMerge (Win32; comes with TortoiseSVN) (Matthew
            Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>)
        - rename and drop now actually perform the specified rename or
          deletion when the argument --execute is passed.  (Richard
          Levitte <richard@levitte.org>)
        - 'help' command, same as --help (Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>).
        - 'usher' support: experimental method for proxying multiple
          netsync servers through a single port (similar concept to
          vhosts) (Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>)
        - support long passphrases (Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>)
        - Faster binary file detection (Eric Anderson
          <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>)
        - netsync speedups:
          - when handling large files (Eric Anderson
            <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>)
          - when handling many branches (Marcel van der Boom
            <marcel@hsdev.com>)
        - new system to allow crash logs to contain not just execution
          traces, but also dumps of data being handled when the error
          was detected -- greatly improves debuggability of user
          crashes.
        - complete rework of path handling code, for clarity,
          robustness, and speed.  No user visible changes, except for
          the many bugs fixed.  (Special thanks to Matthew Gregan
          <kinetik@orcon.net.nz> and Grahame Bowland
          <grahame@angrygoats.net>.)
          - however, if you have non-normalized paths in your history
            (symptom: fresh pulls with 0.18 work, but fresh pulls with
            0.19 do not), then 0.23 will report an error and refuse to
            handle the affected revisions.  Since it is believed this
            only affects one project, and to conserve core developer
            time, implementing a migration was put off for now.  If
            this causes problems or for more details, please send an
            email to monotone-devel@nongnu.org.
        - as always, many small bug fixes, speedups, and improved
          messages.

        Other new monotone-related projects since 0.22:
        - mtsh by Timothy Brownawell:
            https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/brownawe/www/mtsh/
          GTK+ wrapper for monotone focusing on working copy
          operations -- add/drop/revert/rename/commit/update/diff and
          browsing.  Has a mechanism for per-file commit comments.

        - "dumb server" support by Nathaniel Smith (share your
          monotone repositories via HTTP/FTP, no netsync daemon
          needed):
            http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net//branch.psp?branch=net.venge.monotone.dumb
          Still needs a command-line frontend to be usable, among
          other things.  Help wanted.  In python.

        - m7 by Larry Hastings <larry@hastings.org>
            http://www.midwinter.com/~lch/programming/m7/
          Experimental drop-in command-line wrapper for monotone.
          Uses certs to add local incrementing version numbers, and an
          enhanced annotate front-end.

Mon Aug  8 23:23:53 PDT 2005

        0.22 release.  new crypto library, bug fixes, ui improvements

        - switch from crypto++ to botan as underlying crypto library.
          this should not cause any user-visible changes; let us know
          if it does.  special thanks to Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>, Kaushik Veeraraghavan
          <kaushikv@gmail.com>, Matthew Gregan
          <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
        - incompatible change to netsync permission hooks: the
          get_netsync_anonymous_read_permitted hook has been removed;
          instead, get_netsync_read_permitted will be called with a
          key name of nil.  server administrators should update/review
          their configuration
        - new option for merge and propagate: --lca.  Until we get a
          long-term solution to the various 3-way merge problems, this
          should be more convenient than using explicit_merge.
        - many small improvements to error messages, fixes of minor
          annoyances, netsync tickers more accurate, etc.

Sun Jul 17 16:48:26 PDT 2005

        0.21 release.  bug fixes, performance improvements, and ui
        improvements.

        - fixes a number of major performance bugs in 0.20's netsync
          implementation.  special thanks to Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
        - fixes a number of major bugs in 0.20's (rewritten)
          cvs_import command.
        - configury kluges to work around g++ 4.0/boost 1.32
          incompatibilities.  special thanks to Christof Petig
          <christof@petig-baender.de>, Matthew Gregan
          <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>, Jordan Breeding
          <jordan.breeding@mac.com>.
        - ui enhancements:
          - new netsync option "--exclude": branches are included if
            they match any of the given globs, unless they match any
            of the given --exclude globs.  special thanks to Timothy
            Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
          - new netsync option client "--set-default": makes it easy
            to change default server/branches.
          - "diff" now takes options "--context" and "--external", to
            output context diffs and to invoke an external diff
            program for full control over output formatting.  new
            option "--diff-args" pass arguments to external diff
            program; new hook "external_diff" allows further
            configuration.  special thanks to Vladimir Vukicevic
            <vladimirv@gmail.com>.
          - b: and t: selectors now match exactly, instead of matching
            as substrings.  globbing is supported for inexact
            matching.  special thanks to Brian Downing
            <bdowning@lavos.net>, Jordan Breeding
            <jordan.breeding@mac.com>.
          - new command 'db kill_tag_locally'.  special thanks to Jordan
            Breeding <jordan.breeding@mac.com>.
        - now uses sqlite3 prepared statements.  special thanks to
          Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - 'db migrate' is now a complete no-op if there is no
          migration to do; automated scripts can now call it
          optimistically and cheaply to guarantee up-to-dateness.
        - new hash correctness tests.  special thanks to Kaushik
          Veeraraghavan <kaushikv@gmail.com>.

                - upgrading from 0.20: you must run 'monotone db
                  migrate' once against each of your databases, to add
                  new sql indexes.

Tue Jul  5 23:57:10 PDT 2005

        0.20 release.  features, ui improvements, performance
        improvements, and bug fixes.

        - major changes in netsync UI: serve/sync/push/pull now take a
          list of globs; clients can request arbitrary sets of
          branches, not just predefined "collections".  write
          permissions are now granted on a per-db level (they were
          before anyway).
                - where you used to say, e.g., "monotone pull
                  net.venge.monotone", you should instead say
                  "monotone pull net.venge.monotone*".  This may
                  require shell-quoting.
                - 'get_netsync_write_permitted' hooks must be changed
                  to take only one argument, the 'identity'.
                  'get_netsync_{read,anonymous_read}_permitted' hooks
                  now take a branch argument instead of a collection,
                  and will be called for each branch that a client
                  requests.
                - 0.19 clients cannot talk to 0.20 servers, and vice-versa.
                - special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
                  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>, Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
        - other major changes:
                - cvs_import re-written; many bugs fixed.  now
                  supports tags.
        - many minor netsync changes:
                - netsync traffic is now cryptographically authenticated
                  against corruption and man-in-the-middle attacks.
                  special thanks to Ethan Blanton <elb@elitists.net>,
                  Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
                - new hooks that are called when server receives data:
                  note_netsync_*_received.  special thanks to Timothy
                  Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
                - ancestry graphs that pass outside the given branch
                  are now synchronized correctly.  special thanks to
                  Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
        - UI improvements:
                - 'log' options changed: --depth has become --last;
                  new options --no-merges, --diffs, --brief.
                - 'status' has new option --brief.  special thanks to
                  Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
                - 'serve' has new option --pid-file.  special thanks
                  to Matthew Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - all commands taking restrictions now take option
                  --depth, to limit recursion through subdirectories.
                  special thanks to Joel Reed <joelwreed@comcast.com>.
                - merge command all take --author, --date now.
                - 'checkout', 'update' take --revision, instead of
                  using positional arguments.  special thanks to Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'commit' takes new --message-file option.
        - new features:
                - new commands: "db kill_branch_locally", "db
                  kill_revision_locally", useful for correcting some
                  mistakes.  special thanks to Brian Campbell
                  <brian.p.campbell@dartmouth.edu>, Sebastian Spaeth
                  <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - new file attribute 'manual_merge', to prevent invocation of
                  merger on binary files.  hook added to guess correct
                  value at 'add' time.  special thanks to Riccardo
                  Ghetta <birrachiara@tin.it>.
                - new 'earlier than', 'later than' selectors.  special
                  thanks to Riccardo Ghetta <birrachiara@tin.it>.
        - new automate commands:
                - 'stdio', for efficient use by
                  front-ends.  special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
                  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
                - 'certs', for fetching certs on a revision in a
                  parseable (basic io-based) format.  special thanks
                  to Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>.
                - 'inventory' output changed incompatibly; should be
                  much more usable now, and stable.  special thanks to
                  Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - better memory/performance when handling large files.
          special thanks to Eric Anderson
          <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>, Timothy Brownawell
          <tbrownaw@gmail.com>, Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
          Matthew Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
        - new text mode browser in contrib/mtbrowse.sh, by Henry
          Nestler <Henry@BigFoot.de>.
        - improved zsh completion in contrib/monotone.zsh_completion,
          by Joel Reed <joelwreed@comcast.com>.

                - upgrading from 0.19: database and working copies are
                  fully compatible.  netsync clients and servers need
                  to be upgraded together, as described above.  the
                  many ui changes may require script updates.

Tue May  3 00:31:37 PDT 2005

        0.19 release.  performance improvements, features, ui
        improvements, and bug fixes.

        - many operations sped up by another factor of 2 or better.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
                - first steps towards automated benchmarking.  Thanks
                  to Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
        - new major features:
                - "annotate" command; still requires optimization.
                  Thanks to Emile Snyder <emile@alumni.reed.edu>.
                - "inodeprints" for fast change detection in large
                  working dirs now fully supported; see manual for
                  details.
        - new minor features:
                - new selector "c:name=value" for selecting on
                  arbitrary certs.  Thanks to Richard Levitte

                - new hooks to automatically initialize attributes on
                  add; monotone now automatically sets execute bit on
                  executables.  Thanks to Joel Reed
                  <joelwreed@comcast.net>.
                - new automate command "select", to do selector
                  expansion.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - new automate commands "graph", "parents",
                  "children", "ancestors", to easily inspect history.
                  Special thanks to Sebastian Spaeth
                  <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>.
                - new command "db kill_rev_locally".  Thanks to
                  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - new arguments to "commit": --author, --date; useful
                  for patch attribution and importing history.
                - new automate command "inventory" (output format will
                  change in next release, however).  Thanks to Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - ui improvements:
                - netsync progress ticker in kilobytes/megabytes.
                  Thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au> and
                  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - tickers do not cause annoying scrolling when wider
                  than window.  Special thanks to Matthew Gregan
                  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - warn users when a commit creates divergence, and
                  when an update ignores it.  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - support for command-specific options (there is still
                  no rule that such options must appear after the
                  command on the command line, though).  Thanks to
                  Richard Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
        - bug fixes:
                - many cvs_import bugs fixed.  Special thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>, Emile Snyder
                  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>, Hansjoerg Lipp
                  <hjlipp@web.de>, Matthew Gregan
                  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - windows/unix working copy line ending conversion now
                  works correctly.  Thanks to Emile Snyder
                  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>.
                - many fixes to i18n-ized filename support
                - "drop" and "rename" now affect file attributes as
                  well.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org> and Joel Reed
                  <joelwreed@comcast.com>.
                - better error reporting in netsync.  Thanks to
                  Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>.
                - only set working directory's default branch on some
                  commands (update, commit).  Thanks to Florian Weimer
                  <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
                - "db check" now sets exit status correctly, for use
                  in scripts.  Thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - many others...
        - fantastic emacs integration in contrib/monotone.el.  Thanks
          to Harley Gorrell <harley@panix.com>.
        - 45 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~84%.

                - upgrading from 0.18: database and working copies are
                  fully compatible.  NOTE that the configuration file
                  is now ~/.monotone/monotonerc, rather than old
                  ~/.monotonerc.  Simply create ~/.monotone, and
                  rename any existing configuration file.

Sun Apr 10 17:49:25 PDT 2005

        0.18 release.  performance improvements, features, and bug fixes.
	This release is dedicated to Shweta Narayan.

        - most operations sped up by a factor of 2 or better; many sped up
	  by up several orders of magnitude.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>, Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Linus Torvalds
                  <torvalds@osdl.org>.
        - new concept: "database vars".  Used in several features below.
        - new features:
                - new file "MT/log" can be edited while you work,
                  sets default changelog.  (no change in behaviour if
                  you do not edit it.)  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - monotone now stores default netsync
                  server/collection, initialized on first use of
                  netsync.
                - you no longer need to manually import server
                  keys, monotone will fetch the key from the server on
                  first netsync.
                - monotone keeps track of keys of servers you have
                  previously synced with, to prevent man-in-the-middle
                  attacks.
                - several powerful new "automate" commands added.
		- new command 'ls known', lists files that are under version
		  control.  Thanks to Florian Weimer <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
		- preliminary "inodeprints" functionality -- speeds up diff,
		  status, etc.  No UI or documentation yet -- in a working
		  copy, 'touch MT/inodeprints' to enable, then commit or
		  update to populate cache.
        - UI improvements:
                - Added short options -r, -b, -k, -m.
                - default to 'dot' ticker-style when stderr is
                  not a tty, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - New "-@/--xargs" option, helpful when using new
                  automate commands.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - New "--depth" argument to 'log'.  Thanks to Richard
                  Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'db info' gives statistics on space usage.
                - new command 'dropkey'.  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
        - robustness improvement: if monotone crashes in a working
          directory and --dump and --debug were not specified, saves
          debug dump to "MT/debug" for analysis, instead of
          discarding.
        - new contributed scripts: CIA (cia.navi.cx) notification,
          email notification, Bash completion.
        - 33 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~82%.
        - many bug fixes
		- Special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
		  for going above and beyond to track down the last
		  release blocker.

                - upgrading from 0.17 requires only a 'db migrate'.

Fri Mar 18 15:38:52 PST 2005

        0.17 release. bug fixes and features.

        - many, many robustness improvements
                - more careful checking everywhere
                - much more thorough test suite
                - all revisions subject to careful checks before
                  entering database
                        - not yet fully optimized; "pull" may be very
                          slow and use lots of cpu
                - support for "epochs", to safely manage future
                  rebuilds, hash migration, etc.
                - new "db check" command, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
        - now uses sqlite3, thanks to Christof Petig
          <christof@petig-baender.de>.
                - removes most former size limitations
        - "restrictions" support, thanks to Derek Scherger
          <derek@echologic.com>.
                - most commands now take a list of files to limit
                  their actions to
                - monotone can now be run from anywhere in the working
                  directory (not just the root)
                - new command "monotone setup" required to create a
                  working directory for a new project
        - important security fix -- don't use shell when calling
          external merge commands.
        - format change for "MT/options", ".mt-attrs"; you may have to
          edit these files
                - new command "attr" for managing .mt-attrs.
        - builds merkle tries in-memory -- netsync starts up many
          times faster
        - start of new "automate" interface, for shell scripts and
          others.
        - new command "cdiff": generates context diffs.
        - remove most of now-obsolete manifest/file cert support.
        - 60+ new integration tests.
        - many portability fixes
                - in particular, major win32 cleanups, thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>.  win32 is once again
                  fully and natively supported.
        - many bug fixes

                - several incompatible changes: see file UPGRADE for
                  migration information

	to dump existing databases before upgrading and reload it
	after upgrading, otherwise monotone will complain that the
	database image appears malformed. this condition cannot
	unfortunately be distinguished from a real malformed image on
	disk. for example:
