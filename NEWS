??? ??? ?? ??:??:?? UTC 2008

        0.39 release.

        Changes

        - 'mtn di' is now an alias for 'mtn diff'.

        - 'automate db_set' has been renamed to 'automate set_db_variable'.

        - 'automate db_get' has been replaced by 'automate get_db_variables'
          which returns all database variables similar to 'list vars' in
          basic_io format, optionally restricted by domain.

        - messages describing conflicts from all of the various merge commands
          have been reworked and should be much more informative.

        - mtn show_conflicts now outputs much more detailed and descriptive
          messages, however it may report content conflicts that will be
          resolved automatically by the line merger.

        Bugs fixed

        - for changes near the beginning of a file, mtn's unified diff
          output sometimes contained too many leading context lines.

        New features

        - 'automate drop_db_variables' which drops one database variable
          (like the 'unset' command) or all variables within a given domain.

        - 'automate inventory' now accepts options '--no-ignored',
          '--no-unknown', '--no-unchanged'. In addition, it no longer
          recurses into ignored directories. The typical case of
          listing files that need attention now runs at least four
          times faster.

Wed Dec 12 21:21:15 UTC 2007

        0.38 release.

        Changes

        - mtn log now prints a single dot for a project's root
          directory instead of an empty string.

        - mtn now warns if changes to a file will be ignored because
          the file has been deleted on one side of a merge.

        - mtn now errors if your chosen private key doesn't match the public
          key of the same name in your database.

        - mtn now checks for your key before a merge action takes place to
          ensure that any manually merged file isn't lost in an error case

        Bugs fixed

        - a bug introduced in 0.37 prevented an external merger from being
          executed unless the MTN_MERGE environment variable was set

        - mtn read successfully reads revision data, and cert packets again

        - mtn consistently supports certs with empty values
          (fixed 'ls certs' and 'read')

        Internal

        - Update Botan to 1.7.2.

        - Moved the gzip implementation out of the Botan directory.

        Other

        - Added the scripts of the following Lua-based contributed
          Monotone extension commands to contrib/command/:
          "mtn base", "mtn fuse", "mtn revision", "mtn conflicts".

        - Added a hooks version of the contributed ciabot script,
          contrib/ciabot_monotone_hookversion.lua

        - The monotone manual is now licensed under the GPL rather than
          the GFDL.

Fri Oct 25 22:35:33 UTC 2007

        0.37 release.

        Changes

        - mtn db kill_rev_locally now checks for an existing workspace
          before the revision is killed and tries to apply the changes
          of this particular revision back to the workspace to allow
          easy re-committing afterwards

        - the "--brief" switch for mtn annotate has been renamed to
          "--revs-only" for clarity

        - mtn help now lists the commands (and their aliases) available
          within a group, so its easier to get an overview which commands
          are available at all

        - the "MTN_MERGE=diffutils" merger (provided by std_hooks.lua)
          was improved. It now accepts a MTN_MERGE_DIFFUTILS environment
          variable which can be used to control its behaviour
          through comma-separated "key[=value]" entries. Currently
          supported entries are "partial" for doing a partial
          batch/non-modal 3-way merge conflict "resolution" which uses
          embedded content conflict markers and "diff3opts=[...]" and
          "sdiffopts=[...]" for passing arbitrary options to the used
          "diff3" and "sdiff" tools. When used in combination with "mtn
          merge_into_workspace" this way one especially can achieve a
          CVS/SVN style non-modal workspace-based merging.

        - There is a new revision selector: "p:REV" selects the
          parent(s) of revision REV.  For example, if a revision has
          one parent,

             mtn diff -r p:REV -r REV

          will show the changes made in that revision.

        - Monotone now uses the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression
          (PCRE) library for all regular expressions, instead of the
          boost::regex library.  This means that external Boost
          libraries are no longer required to build or use Monotone.
          If building from source, you will still need the Boost headers
          available somewhere.  See INSTALL for details.

          PCRE's syntax for regular expressions is a superset of
          boost::regex's syntax; it is unlikely that any existing
          .mtn-ignore files or other user uses of regexps will break.
          The manual now contains detailed documentation of the regexp
          syntax, borrowed from PCRE itself.

        - the format of "mtn automate inventory" has changed to basic_io.
          This fixes a couple of corner cases where the old format
          returned wrong information and introduces new capabilities like
          restricted output, recognized attribute changes, and more.
          For a complete overview on the new format, please take a look
          in the appropriate manual section.

        Bugs fixed

        - mtn automate heads called without a branch argument now properly
          returns the head revisions of the workspace's branch if called
          over mtn automate stdio

        - mtn commit no longer crashes if it creates a revision whose
          roster already exists, i.e. was left behind by the command
          `mtn db kill_rev_locally REV` (savannah #18990)

        Documentation changes

        - the documentation of the "--revs-only" (formerly "--brief")
          switch for the annotate command didn't match its actual
          behavior, this has been fixed

        - documentation for the "ssh_agent_add" command was missing
          and has been added

        Other

        - contrib/usher.cc has been removed. Please use the
          net.venge.monotone.contrib.usher branch instead.

        Internal

        - Update SQLite to 3.4.1.

        - Update Lua to 5.1.2 plus latest bug fixes.

        - Update Botan to 1.5.10.

        - Internal use of regular expressions has been almost eliminated.
          (Regular expressions are still used for .mtn-ignore and the
          --show-encloser feature of mtn diff, and are still available to
          Lua hooks.)



Fri Aug  3 06:08:36 UTC 2007

        0.36 release.

        Changes

        - The help command is now able to show documentation on subcommands
          (such as 'attr set').

        - The help command now shows a brief abstract of each command,
          instead of only listing their names.

        - The command `list changed` now outputs the new path of any
          renamed item making it easier to copy and paste these paths
          for external program usage.

        - `automate attributes` has been renamed to `automate get_attributes`,
          also a bug has been fixed there so resurrected attributes are now
          properly outputted as "new" and not "changed".

        New features

        - Two new commands to set and drop attributes over automate:
          `automate set_attribute` and `automate drop_attribute`

        - There is a new function available to the lua hooks,
          'server_request_sync(what, address, include, exclude)', which will
          initate a netsync connection to the server at "address", with the
          given include and exclude patterns, and will sync, push, or pull,
          as given in the "what" argument. If called from a monotone instance
          which is not acting as a server, this function will do nothing.

        - There is a new hook available,
          'get_netsync_key(server, include, exclude)', which is called to
          determine which key to use for netsync operations. Note that the
          server calls this once at startup with the address it is listening
          on, "*", and "" as arguments, rather than for each connection.

        Other

        - Giving the --confdir argument will automatically set the key store
          directory to keys/ under that directory, unless --keydir is also
          given. This is a bugfix.

        - Fixed a regression in 0.35 that resulted in some databases
          becoming significantly larger when storing new revisions. Existing
          databases with this problem can be fixed by pulling into a fresh
          database using 0.36.

        - contrib/lua-mode.el, a Lua mode for GNU emacs.

        - contrib/monotone-buildbot-notification.lua, a netsync hook to have a
          server notify a buildbot when new changes have arrived.  Useful for
          anyone who uses a buildbot with monotone as source.

        - contrib/monotone-cluster-push.lua, a netsync hook script to have
          arriving changes be forwarded to other servers automatically.  It
          uses the new internal lua function 'server_request_sync'.

        - contrib/mtn_makepermissions, a simple script to create
          read-permissions and write-permissions from files in the directories
          read-permissions.d and write-permissions.d, Debian style.

        - contrib/Monotone.pm, a first attempt to write a Perl module to
          interface with 'monotone automate stdio'.

        - contrib/monotone-import.pl has been removed since monotone now has
          an internal import command.

        Internal

        - Commands are now defined as a tree of commands instead of a
          plain list, which allows the help system to look up information
          of a command at an level in the tree.

        - The command class, the automate class and all the associated
          macros have been cleaned up.

        - All C++ files now depend on base.hh, which includes the few things
          that are used virtually everywhere.  'make distcheck' will check for
          the presence of base.hh in all source files and will protest if
          it's not there.  This is explained further in HACKING.

        - Update the internal SQLite to version 3.4.0.

        - Updated Visual C building system, which now also builds the test
          programs.  The script visualc/runtests.bat can be used to run the
          tests.

        - Monotone can now be built successfully with Boost 1.34. Older
          versions of monotone would sometimes seem to work depending on
          the compiler used, but would have bugs in path normalization.

        - Monotone now requires Boost 1.33 or later.

        - The Boost filesystem library is no longer required.

        - The Boost unit test system is no longer required.



Mon May  7 14:08:44 UTC 2007

        0.35 release.

        Changes

        - 'mkdir --no-respect-ignore PATH' now really skips any
          ignore directives from .mtn-ignore or Lua hooks

        - Private keys are now stored more safely, using file
          permissions.

        - The editable log summary (what you get in an editor when
          committing without -m) now includes information about which
          branch the commit applies to.

        - The status command and the editable log summary now show
          the same details about the change.

        New features

        - 'automate identify', an automate version of 'mtn identify'.

        - 'automate roots', prints the roots of the revision graph,
          i.e. all revisions that have no parents.

        Other

        - You can't drop the workspace root any more.

        Internal

        - Update the internal Lua to version 5.1.2.

        - Added build files for Mac OS X.

        - Update the internal SQLite to version 3.3.17.

        - Code cleanup of app_state.



Sun Apr  1 08:23:34 UTC 2007

        0.34 release.

        The internal data format has changed with this release;
        migration is straight-forward.  To upgrade your databases,
        you must run:
               $ mtn -d mydb.mtn db migrate
        All of these operations are completely lossless, and 0.34
        remains compatible with earlier versions all the way back
        to 0.26 with regards to netsync.

        Changes

        - Text is now output at best of the environment's possibilities,
          transliterating them or substituting '?' as needed.

        - The lua hook get_author() now takes a second argument, a
          key identity, in case someone wants to create an author based
          on that and not only the branch name.

        - The command 'chkeypass' became 'passphrase'.

        - The commands 'drop', 'rename' and 'pivot_root' default to
          always perform the operation in the file system as well.
          They do not accept '--execute' any more, but will instead
          take '--bookkeep-only' in case the user only wants to affect
          bookkeeping files.

        New features

        - New hook note_mtn_startup(), which is called when monotone is
          started.

        - New Lua support function spawn_pipe(), which is used to run
          a command and get back its standard input and standard output
          file handles as well as the pid.

        - Monotone will automatically add a monotone key in a resident
          ssh-agent when it's first used, and will then use ssh-agent
          for all subsequent signing.  Thus, you will only need to give
          the password once in one session.
        - New command 'ssh_agent_export' to export a monotone key into
          an SSH key.
        - New command 'ssh_agent_add' to add a monotone key explicitly
          to a resident ssh-agent.

        - New command 'clone' that combines 'pull' and 'checkout'.

        - 'automate put_file' and 'automate put_revision' stores a file
          and a revision in the database.

        - 'automate cert', an automate version of 'mtn cert'.
        - 'automate db_set', an automate version of 'mtn set'.
        - 'automate db_get', an automate version of 'mtn ls vars' with
          a twist.

        Other

        - contrib/ciabot_monotone_hookversion.py now uses a real
          basic_io parser and thus should send more precise
          information to the cia server. Furthermore, it has become
          more careful with creating zombies.

        - contrib/monotone-log-of-pulled-revs-hook.lua, a lua hook
          to display information about incoming revisions.

        - contrib/monotone-mirror-postaction-push.sh, a post action
          script that should be executed by contrib/monotone-mirror.sh
          to automatically push data on to other servers.

        - contrib/monotone-mirror.lua, a lua hook that executes
          contrib/monotone-mirror.sh after any netsync session is done.

        - contrib/monotone-mirror.sh now takes keydir and keyid
          configuration and has better protection against overlapping
          duplicate runs.

        - contrib/monotone.bash_completion now handles signals.

        - contrib/monotone.el now includes a commit button.

        Internal

        - Date and time display has now been reimplemented internally
          to avoid Boost more.  This means that we have lowered our
          dependency from Boost 1.33.0 to 1.32.0.

        - Lots of code cleanup.

        - The heights cache got an index, making the processing faster.

        - Update the internal SQLite to version 3.3.13.

        - Algorithm to find uncommon ancestors has been rewritten, so
          'pull' and 'regenerate_caches' should be faster.


Wed Feb 28 22:02:43 UTC 2007

        0.33 release.

        The internal data format has changed with this release;
        migration is straight-forward.  To upgrade your databases,
        you must run:
               $ mtn -d mydb.mtn db migrate
        All of these operations are completely lossless, and 0.33
        remains compatible with earlier versions with regards to
        netsync.

        Changes

        - "mtn ls unknown" no longer recurses into unknown directories.

        - update will fail rather than clobbering unversioned files
          that exist in the workspace.

        - update will detect directories with unversioned files before
          attempting to drop them and will refuse to run rather than
          corrupting the workspace. such unversioned files must be
          removed manually.

        - the character set and line separator conversion hooks
          (get_system_linesep, get_charset_conv and get_linesep_conv)
          have been removed. Similar functionality (probably based on
          file type attributes) is planned and will be added in a future
          release.

        - update will switch to the branch of a given revision if it
          differs from the current workspace branch.

        - add will now accept combinations of --unknown, --recursive and
          --no-respect-ignore.

        - import now imports unknown directory trees properly.

        - use SQLite 3.3.12.

        - schema migrator rebuilt and will now properly detect and report
          if the database used is created by a newer monotone than the one
          currently used.

        - removed the man page mtn.1, as it hadn't been updated for a long
          time.

        New features

        - "mtn merge_into_workspace" (still to be documented).  This command
          will allow you to review and fix up a merge in your workspace
          before committing it to the repository.  However, the conflict
          resolution interface remains the same as that of the 'merge'
          command for now (i.e. monotone will invoke your specified merge
          tool on all files with conflicts and you must resolve them as they
          are presented).  Work on in-workspace conflict presentation and
          resolution is planned for the future.

        - "mtn log" will now print an ASCII revision graph alongside the
          usual log text.

        Speed improvements

        - "mtn annotate file" should run even faster now. it exploits
          the fact that we store deltas of rosters. by peeking at
          these deltas, it can avoid reconstruction of whole rosters
          in many cases.

        Other

        - contrib/monotone-mirror.sh and
          contrib/monotone-mirror-postaction-update.sh, two scripts
          to mirror and update directories automatically.

        - contrib/monotone-run-script-post-netsync.lua, to automatically
          update a directory as soon as new revisions or certs arrive for
          a given branch.

        - contrib/monotone.bash_completion had some improvemens.

        - contrib/monotone.el had some improvements.

        Internal

        - Internally, the concept of "projects" has been introduced.  It
          currently doesn't mean anything, but will be used later, with
          policy branches and similar.



Wed Dec 27 09:57:48 UTC 2006

        0.32 release.

        Changes

        - "mtn serve" no longer takes patterns on the command line.
          Use the permissions hooks instead.

        - the name of the option that denoted the revision from which
          "mtn log" should start logging was renamed from "--revision"
          to "--from"

        - author selectors no longer have implicit wildcarding

        - if you manually add entries to MTN/log while you are
          working, in preparation for an eventual commit, you will now
          be required to remove a "magic" template line from the file
          before the commit will succeed. This, like the test for an
          empty log file, helps to prevent accidents.

        - the "db regenerate_caches" migration command replaces the
          previous "db regenerate_rosters", generalising the task of
          rebuilding or generating cached data that may be added
          across an upgrade.  Like "db migrate", which upgrades the
          database schema, this command fills in the data for new
          features. In this release, as well as rosters, it also adds
          "heights" information used to speed up topology operations.

        Speed improvements

        - "mtn annotate file" and "mtn log file" are generally much
          faster now, dependant on the number of revisions that
          changed the file. Both commands as well as "mtn automate
          toposort" make use of data called "heights" caching the
          topological order of all revisions.  In order to create and
          use this data, the following must be run once for each db
          after upgrading:

               $ mtn -d mydb.mtn db regenerate_caches

        New features

        - "mtn automate content_diff"

        - "mtn automate get_file_of" (same as get_file, but expects
          a file path and optionally a revision)

        - "mtn import" command

        - "mtn log --to"

        - netsync_note_* hooks are given much more information,
          inlcuding a http/smtp/etc style status code

        - includedirpattern(dir, fileglob) function for hooks


        Bugs fixed

        - bug in "automate stdio" that would result in monotone
          garbling its input in some circumstances fixed

        - "mtn annotate file" and "mtn log file" are generally much
          faster now, dependant on the number of revisions that
          changed the file. Both commands as well as "mtn automate
          toposort" make use of data called "heights" caching the
          topological order of all revisions.

        - spawn_redirected hook function now understands a blank
          filename to mean not to redirect that stream

        - "mtn log" is now in proper topological order, also due to
          the use of cached "heights" data

        - reset options between "automate stdio" commands

        - another compile fix for gcc3

        - bug in localization code where option strings where not
          always properly translated


        Other

        - botan library upgraded to 1.6.0

        - accommodate changes in boost 1.34

        - documentation for "mtn automate get_option"

        0.31 release.  Code cleanups and bug fixes.

        New features:

        - If multiple --message (or -m) arguments are passed to
          'commit', then they will be concatenated on separate lines.

        - The validate_commit_message hook is now told what branch the
          commit is on.

        Bugs fixed:

        - The typo that prevented building with gcc 3.3 has been
          fixed.

        - Attempting to commit without a signing key available now
          fails earlier.

        - Command-line option parsing has been redone yet again; this
          should fix a number of bugs caused by the use of
          boost::program_options.  For instance, command line error
          messages are now l10nized again, "--depth=asdf" now gives a
          sensible error message instead of crashing, and --key= now
          works as an alternative to -k "".

        - A bug in the new roster caching logic that caused assertion
          failures on very large trees has been fixed.

        - A rare bug in the "epoch refinement" phase of the netsync
          protocol has been fixed.

        - Accidental (and undocumented) change to 'automate inventory'
          output format reverted; documentation is now correct again.

        - Some obscure error conditions with 'pivot_root' fixed.

        Many fixes to 'automate stdio':

        - IO handling has been rewritten, to remove some
          obscure bugs and clean up the code.

        - automate commands can now take options (even when used with
          'automate stdio').

        - The default block size has been increased to 32k (which
          should considerably reduce overhead).

        - Many automate commands were flushing their output far too
          often, causing major slowdowns when used with 'automate
          stdio'; this has been fixed.

        - Syntax errors now cause 'automate stdio' to exit, rather
          than attempting to provide usage information for the calling
          program to read.

        Other:

        - New large-coverage random testsuite for delta reconstruction
          path finding algorithm.

        - Miscellaneous code cleanups and improved error messages.

        - Enhancements to debian packaging.

        - New translation to es (Spanish).

Sun Sep 17 12:27:08 PDT 2006

        0.30 release.  Speed improvements, bug fixes, and improved
        infrastructure.

        Several internal data formats have changed with this release;
        migration is straight-forward, but slightly more complicated
        than usual:
          -- The formats used to store some cached data in the
             database have changed.  To upgrade your databases, you
             must run:
               $ mtn -d mydb.mtn db migrate
               $ mtn -d mydb.mtn db regenerate_rosters
          -- The metadata stored in _MTN in each workspace has been
             rearranged slightly.  To upgrade your workspaces, you
             must run
               $ mtn migrate_workspace
             in each workspace.
        All of these operations are completely lossless, and 0.30
        remains compatible with earlier versions with regards to
        netsync.

        Speed improvements:

        - Algorithm used to find branch heads rewritten, to use vastly
          less memory and cpu.  This not only makes 'mtn heads'
          faster, but also 'mtn commit', 'mtn update', and other
          commands, which were spending most of their time in this
          code.

        - The format used in the database to store the roster cache
          was rewritten.  This makes initial pull approximately twice
          as fast, and somewhat improves the speed of restricted log,
          annotate, and so on.

        - The xdelta algorithm was further optimized.

        - A memory leak in Botan was fixed, which was causing
          excessive memory and CPU time to be spent during 'mtn
          checkout'.

        - Monotone has fast-paths for doing character set conversion
          when the system it is running on uses plain ASCII.  These
          fast-paths now know that "646" is another name used for
          ASCII, and systems that use this name (like some BSDs) now
          benefit from the fast-paths.

        - Miscellaneous other improvements.

        Workspace format changes:

        - It is now possible to write down a multi-parent (merge)
          workspace.  However, monotone will still refuse to work with
          such a workspace, and there is no way to create one.  This
          change merely sets up infrastructure for further changes.

        - _MTN/revision no longer contains only the parent revision
          id; if you depended on this in scripts, use 'mtn automate
          get_base_revision_id' instead.  Also, _MTN/work has been
          removed.

        UI changes:

        - 'mtn status' now includes the branch name and parent
          revision id in its output.

        - The output of 'mtn annotate' and 'mtn annotate --brief' has
          been switched.  The more human-readable output is now the
          default.

        - 'mtn pluck' now gives an error message if the requested
          operation would have no effect.

        - On command line syntax errors, usage information is now
          printed to stderr instead of stdout.  (Output requested with
          --help still goes to stdout.)  This should make it easier to
          find bugs in scripts.

        Bug fixes:

        - While changelog messages have always been defined to UTF-8,
          we were not properly converting messages from the user's
          locale.  This has now been fixed.

        - An off-by-one error that caused some operations to abort
          with an error message about "cancel_size <
          pending_writes_size" has been fixed.

        - In 0.29, --help output was not localized.  This has been
          fixed.

        - In 0.29, setting merger = "emacs" would not work unless
          EDITOR was also set to "emacs" (and similar for vi).  This
          has been fixed.

        - A rare invariant violation seen when performing certain
          sequences of renames/adds in the workspace has been fixed.

        - If a user failed to resolve the conflicts in a text file, we
          would continue asking them to resolve conflicts in remaining
          files, even though the merge could not succeed.  We now exit
          immediately on failure.

        - Work around some g++ 3.3 brokenness.

        Documentation changes:

        - Imported *-merge documents into the manual (they still need
          to be cleaned up to fit in better).

        Changes to automate:

        - Bug fix in 'attributes': this command is supposed to list
          attributes that were removed from a file in the current
          revision; instead, it was listing all attributes that had
          ever been removed from that file.  Now fixed.

        - New command 'get_corresponding_path': given a revision A, a
          path P, and a revision B, looks up the file with name P in
          revision A, and states what path it had in revision B.

        - New command 'get_content_changed': given a revision A and a
          path P, gives the ancestor of A in which P was last
          modified.

        - New command 'get_option': Fetches variables from
          _MTN/options (e.g., the current workspace's branch and
          database).

        - New command 'genkey': an automate-friendly way to generate a
          new monotone key.

Sun Aug 20 15:58:08 PDT 2006

        0.29 release.  Code cleanups and bug fixes.

        New features:

        - The output of 'mtn status' has been changed significantly; the
          output formerly used by 'mtn status --brief' has become the
          default.  For output similar to the old 'mtn status', see
          'mtn automate get_revision'.

        - It is now significantly easier to control what merger
          monotone uses to resolve conflicts; for instance, to use
          emacs to resolve conflicts, add:
             merger = "emacs"
          to your .monotonerc file.  To override temporarily, you can
          also use the environment variable MTN_MERGE, which takes the
          same strings.  Currently recognized strings are "kdiff3",
          "xxdiff", "opendiff", "tortoisemerge", "emacs", "vim", and
          "meld".

        - Formerly, monotone's sync-over-ssh support required that an
          absolute path be used, with a URL like:
            ssh://venge.net/home/njs/my-db.mtn
          The following syntaxes are now supported as well:
            ssh://venge.net/~/my-db.mtn
            ssh://venge.net/~njs/my-db.mtn

        Bugs fixed:

        - The bug where monotone would sometimes respond to a control-C
          (or several other signals) by locking up and refusing to exit,
          has been fixed.

        - Monotone now properly respects SIGPIPE.  In particular, this
          means that 'mtn log | less' should now exit promptly when
          'less' is exited.

        - 'mtn log' now flushes its output after each message; this
          makes 'mtn log <FILES>' significantly more usable.

        - 'mtn log <FILES>' formerly listed irrelevant revisions (in
          particular, any revision which contained a delete of any files
          or directories, was always included).  This has been fixed.

        - If, during an update, two files both had conflicts, which,
          when resolved, resulting the two files becoming identical, the
          update would error out.  This has been fixed.

        - If _MTN/log exists and does not end in a newline, we now add a
          newline before using the log message.  This removes a problem
          where the string "MTN:" would end up appended to the last line
          of the log message.

        - We no longer buffer up an arbitrarily large number of pending
          writes in the database.  This improves speed and memory usage
          for 'commit', and fixes the problem where 'cvs_import' would
          run out of memory.

        - Monotone's tree walking code (used by 'ls unknown', 'ls
          missing', and friends) now uses much less memory, especially
          on reiserfs.

        Automate changes:

        - 'mtn automate stdio' now uses a configurable block size,
          controlled by command-line option --automate-stdio-size.  This
          is mostly useful for testing speed/memory trade-offs.

        - 'automate attributes' has a new format, which includes more
          information.

        Code cleanup:

        - We now use boost::program_options to parse command line
          options, rather than popt.  The only user-visible change
          should be that --option="" no longer works as a way to set
          some option to the empty string; use --option "".  (This
          change also removes a lot of orphaned and historically buggy
          code from monotone.)

        Other:

        - zsh completion script significantly revised and updated (see
          contrib/monotone.zsh_completion).

Sat Jul 22 01:39:51 PDT 2006

        0.28 release. Cherrypicking, a new testsuite, and some fixes
        and enhancements.

        New features:

        - Cherrypicking with the new "pluck" command. This takes (a restricted
          subset of) the changes in a revision, or between two
          revisions, and applies them to your workspace.  That this
          has happened is not recorded in history; it as if you
          happened to make some very similar changes by hand in your
          workspace.
        - New automate commands, "automate tags" and "automate branches".
        - "diff" now knows how to find enclosing function (or
          whatever) bodies, just like GNU diff's "-p" option.
          -- The regex that defines "enclosing function" can be chosen
             on a per-file basis by a hook function; the default hook
             knows about LaTeX, Texinfo, and most programming
             languages.
          -- This is enabled by default; use --no-show-encloser to
             disable.

        Enhancements:

        - When netsync fails due to permission errors, the server returns a
          semi-intelligible message before dropping the connection.
        - When merging a branch with 3 or more heads, the order in which to
          merge the heads will now automatically be chosen to minimize
          the amount of repeated work that must be done.
        - Crash dumps are now written to $CONFDIR/dump when no workspace is
          available
        - Path validation routines are faster.
        - Inodeprints should be slightly more robust now.
        - New hook get_mtn_command, used to determine the path to the
          mtn binary on a remote host, when using ssh support.
        - "diff" now accepts "-u" and "-c" as short for "--unified"
          (the default) and "--context", respectively.

        Bug fixes:

        - "revert --missing" now works when run in a subdirectory.
        - "revert --missing" now works without any additional files
          being specified.  (You don't have to say "mtn revert
          --missing .".)
        - Fix an edge case where monotone would crash if there was a
          content conflict in a merge for which there was no lca.
        - Fix a case where netsync would sometimes hang during refinement.
        - "mtn help" and "mtn --help" now exit with return code 0.

        Build environment:

        - automake 1.9 is now required.
        - The testsuite has been rewritten, and should be much faster now. It
          also no longer relies on the presence of a *nix userland.
        - Add workaround for gcc 4.1.[01] bug causing "multiple
          definition" errors.

        Internal:

        - Restrictions have been split into path_restrictions and
          node_restrictions, and generally cleaned up more.

Sat Jun 17 14:43:12 PDT 2006

        0.27 release.  Minor bug fixes and enhancements, plus ssh
        support.

        Major new features:

        - Monotone can now push/pull/synchronize over arbitrary
          bidirectional streams, not just raw TCP.
          - File-to-file synchronization is enabled out of the box,
            e.g.:
              $ mtn -d db1.mtn sync file:/path/to/db2.mtn
          - SSH synchronization is enabled out of the box, e.g.:
              $ mtn -d local.mtn sync ssh://njs@venge.net/home/njs/remote.mtn
            Note that this requires mtn be installed on the remote
            computer, and locks the remote database while running; it
            is not ideal for groups accessing a shared database.
          - New protocols can be defined with Lua hooks -- for
            example, someone could in principle make "$ mtn sync
            xmpp://njs@jabber.org" do something interesting.
          - See section "Other Transports" under "Advanced Uses" in the
            for more details.

        Minor new features:

        - Selectors now support escaping, e.g., b:foo\/bar can be used
          to refer to a branch with name "foo/bar" (normally / is a
          metacharacter that separates multiple selectors).
        - Visual C++ can now build monotone on Windows.  (Mostly
          important because it allows better Windows debugging.)
        - --quiet now turns tickers off, and does not turn warnings
          off.  New option --reallyquiet disables warnings as well.
        - New command 'automate common_ancestors'.
        - 'ls branches' now takes a pattern, e.g.:
            $ mtn ls branches "*contrib*"

        Speed improvements:

        - Bug in select() loop fixed, server should no longer pause in
          processing other clients while busy with one, but multiplex
          fairly.
        - The database has a new write buffer which gives significant
          speed improvements in initial pulls by cancelling redundant
          database writes.
        - There's been a fair bit of performance tuning all around.

        Bug fixes:

        - Merge tools that exit in failure are now detected.
        - Better reporting of operating system errors on Win32.
        - Passphrases stored in ~/.monotonerc are no longer written to
          the log file.  (Passphrases entered at the terminal were
          never written to the log file.)
        - Fix sql injection bugs in selectors, making it safe to
          expose slectors in web interfaces etc.
        - Files marked with the mtn:execute attr now respect umask.
        - 'automate' commands on Win32 now disable newline translation
          on their output; this is especially important for 'automate
          stdio'.
        - 'db check' now calls the sqlite "PRAGMA integrity_check", to
          validate the integrity of things like sqlite indices.
        - 'mtn annotate nonexistent-file' now gives a proper error
          message, instead of an assertion error.
        - 'mtn revert --missing' now works correctly when run in a
          subdirectory.
        - 'automate inventory' no longer fails when _MTN/work contains
          patch stanzas.

        Other:

        - Many, many internal code cleanups
          - Including changes to somewhat reduce the size of the
            binary
        - New tutorial on using packets added to the manual
        - Updated translations, improved error messages, etc.

        Reliability considerations:

        - In the two months since 0.26 was released, zero serious bugs
          have been reported in the new code.

Sat Apr  8 19:33:35 PDT 2006

        0.26 release.  Major enhancements and internal rewrites.
        Please read these notes carefully, as significant changes are
        described.  In particular, you _cannot_ upgrade to 0.26
        without some attention to the migration, especially if you are
        working on a project with other people.  See UPGRADE for
        details of this procedure.

        The changes are large enough that there were 3 pre-releases of
        this code; the changes that occurred in each can be seen
        below.  However, for the convenience of those following
        releases, all changes since 0.25 will be summarized in these
        release notes.  There is no need to read the pre-release notes
        individually.

        Major changes since 0.25:

        - The most user-visible change is that the default name of the
          monotone binary has changed to 'mtn'.  So, for example, you
          would now run 'mtn checkout', 'mtn diff', 'mtn commit',
          etc., instead of 'monotone checkout', 'monotone diff',
          'monotone commit'.
          - Similarly, the name of the workspace bookkeeping directory
            has changed from "MT" to "_MTN".  As workspaces will
            generally be recreated when migrating to this release,
            this should not cause any problems.
          - Similarly, built-in attrs like 'execute' have had 'mtn:'
            prepended to their names.  For example, executable files
            should now have the attr 'mtn:execute' set to 'true' on
            them.  The migration code will automatically add this
            prefix; no user intervention is needed.
          - Similarly, the name of the ignore file has changed from
            '.mt-ignore' to '.mtn-ignore'.  The migration code will
            automatically rename this file; no user intervention is
            needed.
          - Similarly, the recommended suffix for monotone db files is
            now '.mtn'.
          These changes are all purely cosmetic, and have no affect on
          functionality.

        - The most developer-visible change is that the data
          structure for representing trees has been completely
          replaced, and all related code rewritten.  The new data
          structure is called a 'roster'.  You don't really need to
          know this name; unless you are hacking on monotone or using
          various debug operations, you will never see a roster.
          It's mostly useful to know that when someone says something
          about 'roster-enabled monotone' or the like, they're
          referring to this body of new code.

          This change has a number of consequences:
          - The textual format for revisions and manifests changed.
            There is no conceptual change, they still contain the same
            information and work the same way.  The formats were
            merely cleaned up to correct various problems experience
            showed us, and allow various enhancements now and in the
            future.  However, this change means that a flag-day
            migration is required.  See UPGRADE for details.
          - Directories are now first-class objects.  You can add an
            empty directory, must drop a directory if you want it to
            go away, etc.
          - Attrs are now first-class objects.  '.mt-attrs' no longer
            exists; attrs are now described directly in the manifest,
            and changes to them appear directly in revisions.  The
            migration code will automatically convert existing
            .mt-attrs files to the new first-class attrs.  If you have
            custom attrs, those may require special handling -- if
            this is the case, then the upgrader will tell you.
          - The merge code has been rewritten completely.  The
            interface is currently the same (though this rewrite makes
            it easier to improve the interface going forward); if you
            have found merging in monotone to be easy in the past,
            then you will not notice anything different.  If you have
            run into problems, then the new merger should make your
            life substantially simpler.  It has full support for
            renames (of both directories and files), intelligent
            merging of attrs, improved handling of file content
            merges.  Is the first known merger implementation based on
            a provably correct algorithm (the "multi-*-merge"
            algorithm), has exhaustive automated tests, and generally
            should give accurate, conservative merges.
          - The new code is generally faster, though not yet as
            fast as it could be.

        Netsync changes:

        - The default netsync port has changed 5253 to 4691.  4691 is
          our official IANA-assigned port.  Please adjust firewalls
          appropriately.

        - Netsync code has also been largely reworked; new code should
          provide better opportunities for optimizations going
          forward.

        - The protocol is incompatible with earlier versions of
          monotone.  This should not be a surprise, since the data it
          carries is also incompatible (see above)...

        New features:

        - New option --brief to 'annotate', gives somewhat more
          friendly output.

        - Several enhancements to log:
          - New option --next, to display descendent revisions
            (rather than ancestor revisions).
          - When 'log -r' is given an ambiguous selector, it now just
            logs all matching revisions, instead of requiring the
            selector be disambiguated.
          - New option --no-files.

        - New command 'show_conflicts', performs a dry run merge.

        - New command 'ls changed'.

        - 'rename' (and its alias 'mv') now accept a broader range of
          syntax:
            mtn rename foo some_dir
              -> renames foo to some_dir/foo
            mtn rename foo bar baz some_dir
              -> moves foo, bar, and baz to some_dir/foo,
              some_dir/bar, and some_dir/baz

        - New hook 'validate_commit_message', which may be used to
          verify that all commit messages meet arbitrary user-defined
          rules.

        - New option --log, to log monotone's output to a file.

        - New option 'drop --recursive', to remove a directory and its
          contents in one swoop.

        - The root dir may now be renamed.  This is a somewhat exotic
          feature, but has some interesting uses related to splitting
          up or joining together projects; see new commands
          'pivot_root', 'merge_into_dir'.

        Minor bug fixes:

        - 'serve' with no --bind argument should now work on systems
          where the C library has IPv6 support, but the kernel does
          not.

        - Stricter checking on the internal version of filenames to
          ensure that they are valid UTF-8.

        - If the database is in the workspace, then it is always
          ignored.

        - Monotone no longer errors out when using a French (fr)
          locale with a non-Unicode codeset.

        Other changes:

        - Packet commands ('rdata', 'fdata', etc.) have been moved to
          'automate'.

        - Database storage now uses sqlite's blob support; database
          files should be ~1/4 smaller as a result.

        - Monotone now uses sqlite 3.3; this means that older versions
          of the command line client (e.g., an 'sqlite3' command built
          against sqlite version 3.2) cannot be used to poke at a
          monotone 0.26 database.  Solution is to upgrade your sqlite3
          program.  Hopefully this is irrelevant to most users...

        - Translations updated, and 3 new translations added (de, it,
          sv).

        Reliability considerations:

        - This new codebase has received much less testing under real
          world conditions than the codebase used in 0.25, simply
          because it is newer.  It has been in active use for monotone
          development since 8 January 2006, and only a small number of
          bugs have been found; all bugs found so far have been very
          minor, and none stood any danger of corrupting data.
          Furthermore, we are much more confident in the theoretical
          underpinnings of the new approach than the old, and the test
          suite attempts to exhaustively exercise all new code paths.

          However, none of this is or can be a substitute for real
          world experience.  We advise caution in upgrading to this
          version of monotone, and suggest that (especially) those who
          upgrade aggressively should pay extra attention to the
          monotone mailing list before and after doing so.

        0.26pre3 release.  This release may be considered a "release
        candidate", in that while we need to write some tests and make
        sure some bugs are fixed, all features are in and we hope that
        no further bug fixes will be needed either.  It is still a
        pre-release for testing.  Do not package it.  DO NOT USE THIS
        RELEASE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A DAREDEVIL.

        But, PLEASE PLEASE TEST this release.  There are some
        non-trivial changes since 0.26pre2, and this is your last
        chance!

        Major changes since 0.26pre2:

        - The name of the monotone binary has changed to 'mtn'.
          - Similarly, the name of the bookkeeping directory in
            workspaces has changed from 'MT' to '_MTN' (if you have an
            existing 0.26-line workspace, just rename the MT directory
            to _MTN).
          - Similarly, the name of the ignore file has changed from
            ".mt-ignore" to ".mtn-ignore".  'rosterify' will rename
            these automatically (if you have already rosterified, you
            get to rename them by hand).
          - Similarly, the recommended suffix for monotone db files is
            now ".mtn".

        - We now perform stricter checking to make sure that filenames
          are valid UTF-8.  It is in principle possible that this
          stricter checking will cause histories that used to work to
          break; if you have non-ascii filenames, it is strongly
          recommended to test with this release.

        - Root dir renaming is now supported.  See new commands
          'pivot_root', 'merge_into_dir'.
          - As a side-effect, it is now possible to run 'rosterify' on
            histories in which two independent lines of history were
            merged.

        - The security fix released in 0.25.2 has been forward-ported
          to this release; this prevents some security exposure to
          people running monotone as a client on case-insensitive file
          systems.

        Minor change since 0.26pre2:

        - Database now uses sqlite blobs for storage; should be ~1/4
          smaller.
        - New command: show_conflicts, does a dry-run merge.
        - New option 'drop --recursive', to remove a directory and all
          its contents in one swoop.
        - Changes to 'log':
          - New option --no-files
          - Including merges is again the default (i.e., it now acts
            like 0.25, and not like 0.26pre2).
          - When 'log -r' is given an ambiguous selector, it now just
            logs all matching revisions, instead of requiring the
            selector be disambiguated.
        - New option --log, to log monotone output to a file.
        - Netsync changes:
          - Was sending far too much data in some cases; now does not.
          - Several bugs that caused it to lock up fixed
          - Tweak to allow 'usher' proxy to transparently redirect
            based on client's protocol version, to ease migration
            between incompatible protocol versions.
        - Packet commands have been moved to 'automate'.
        - Fixed bugs in 'db kill_rev_locally', should no longer leave
          an inconsistent db behind.
        - Translation updates

        Other projects receiving notable work:

        - Monotone's "dumb server" support (repo distribution over
          HTTP/FTP/SFTP etc.) has been ported to 0.26, a first command
          line version written, etc.
        - The 'usher' netsync proxy used for hosting many databases on
          a single machine has received significant cleanups, and the
          'webhost' project to provide a simple interface to shared
          monotone hosting providers has received even more work.

Sat Feb 11 13:32:51 PST 2006

        0.26pre2 release.  Inching towards 0.26.  If you are using
        0.25 or earlier, then make sure to read the very important
        notes for 0.26pre1, below.  In particular, like 0.26pre1, this
        is a pre-release for testing.  Do not package it.  DO NOT USE
        THIS RELEASE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A DAREDEVIL.

        (Though, in fact, in a month of usage, only one bug has been
        found in the new history code, and it was both minor and
        harmless.  It has additionally been fixed.)

        Database changes:

        - SQLite 3.3.3 has been imported.  3.3 introduces a new database
          format that is not backwards compatible with earlier 3.x releases.
          New databases will be created using this new format.  Existing
          databases remain compatible, and are not converted automatically.
          Existing databases can be converted by performing a database
          vacuum ('monotone db execute vacuum').

        New features:

        - New hook validate_commit_message -- use to verify that all
          commit messages meet arbitrary user-defined rules.

        UI improvements:

        - rename (and mv) commands now accept a broader range of
          syntax:
            monotone rename foo some_dir
              -> renames foo to some_dir/foo
            monotone rename foo bar baz some_dir
              -> moves foo, bar, and baz to some_dir/foo,
                 some_dir/bar, and some_dir/baz
        - Print a warning if it looks like a user has made a quoting
          mistake on push/pull/sync/serve (windows cmd.exe has
          confusing rules here).
        - New command "ls changed".
        - New option "--next" to log, which displays descendents of
          the start revision.
        - Updating to an arbitrary revision now works again (as it did
          in 0.25 and earlier).  This allows one to, for instance,
          switch a working copy to another head, or back up to an
          earlier version, while preserving uncommitted changes.
        - New option --brief to annotate, gives somewhat more friendly
          output.
        - Fixed bug that made ticker output from netsync inaccurate.
        - In 'log', --no-merges is now the default, use --merges to
          override.
        - If the database is in the working copy, then it is always
          ignored.

        Bugs:

        - 'serve' with no --bind should now work on systems where the
          C library has IPv6 support, but the kernel does not.
        - Compile fixes for GCC 4.1 pre-releases.

        Other:
        - Better detection when users have not run "rosterify", and
          more helpful suggestions on what to do in this case.
        - Documentation, translation, error message,
          etc. improvements.
        - Updates to contrib/mtbrowse.sh, simple shell-based monotone
          interface.
        - Updates to many other contrib/ files, mostly to maintain
          compatibility with monotone changes.

Sun Jan  8 01:08:56 PST 2006

        0.26pre1 release.  Massive rewrites, released for shakedown.
        This release is also dedicated to Shweta Narayan.

        This release includes massive changes compared to 0.25.  The
        core versioning code has all been replaced with a completely
        different mechanism.  Data formats and the netsync protocol
        have changed in incompatible ways.

        Migration to 0.26pre1 or later is irreversible and requires a
        flag day for your project.  See UPGRADE for details.  Note
        that we DO NOT recommend upgrading at this time; see below.

        If you have been following the development list for the last
        few months, you may have heard about "rosters" -- this is the
        name for the new core data structure we use.  While the code
        is completely different, the user experience should not be
        very different.  You will never see a roster, unless you are
        debugging monotone itself; everything still revolves around
        revisions, manifests, and certs.

        While this new code has extensive tests, because of these
        incompatibilities, it has never been used for real work.  The
        purpose of this release is to make a version available for the
        monotone developers to begin using for day-to-day work, to
        shake out bugs.

        Let's say that again in caps: THIS CODE IS PROBABLY BUGGY, DO
        NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE A DAREDEVIL.

        However, testing of this version with real databases is a good
        idea, and we'd very much appreciate hearing about your
        experiences.

        Some of the many changes:
        - New textual format for revisions and manifests; they remain
          conceptually the same, but have been tweaked. Manifests
          now use the same "basic_io" format as everything else in
          monotone, and contain entries for directories, revisions
          record file adds slightly differently and record directory
          adds for the first time, etc.  Because of this format
          change, revision hashes are now different; converting
          rosters requires a full history rebuild and reissue of certs.
        - Directories are now first class.  To get rid of a directory
          you must remove it; to create a directory, you must add it.
          You can add an empty directory.
        - Attrs are now first class.  The .mt-attrs file is gone;
          attributes are now stored directly in the manifest.
        - New merge algorithm, based on "multi-*-merge", and more
          aggressive, less buggy merge ancestor selection code
        - Netsync's core has been largely rewritten.  Code is now much
          clearer and more reliable, and now includes the ability to
          resume interrupted partial transfers. The netsync protocol
          version number has been bumped, and netsync now runs on the
          IANA-assigned port 4691 by default.
        - 100% fewer change_set.cc related bugs.  100% more roster.cc
          related bugs.  But the idea of touching roster.cc does not
          terrify people.

Thu Dec 29 23:10:03 PST 2005

        0.25 release.

        Incompatible command line changes:
        - 'monotone revert' now requires an argument.  To revert your
          entire working copy,
            $ monotone revert
          no longer works; instead, go to the root of your working
          copy and run
            $ monotone revert .

        New features:
        - Netsync now supports IPv6 (where OS support exists)

        Bugs fixed:
        - 'revert' gives feedback describing what it changes
        - Database locking further tweaked, to allow more concurrent
          access in situations where this is safe.
        - On win32, ticker display was fixed, so that it no longer
          prints a new line at each update.
        - 'read' can now understand (and migrate) privkey packets
          generated by monotone version 0.23 or earlier.
        - 'log --diffs <files>' now prints only diffs for the given
          files (previously, it would print only revisions in which
          the given files changed, but would print all diffs for those
          revisions).
        - Win9x and WinNT 4 compatibility fixes.

        New translations:
        - pt_BR

Sat Nov 27 22:29:38 PST 2005

        0.24 release.

        Configuration change (Windows only):
        - Configuration directory on Windows has changed.  It used to
          be some complicated and varying function of %HOME%,
          %USERPROFILE%, %HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%, whether you were
          running in mingw/cygwin, etc.  It is now, always,
          %APPDATA%\monotone.  For instance, if your configuration
          file used to be named
           ...\Documents and Settings\user\.monotone\monotonerc
          it will now be named
           ...\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\monotone\monotonerc
          Please rename files appropriately.

        Major key management changes:
        - Private keys are no longer stored in your database.  They
          are stored in ~/.monotone/keys/ (Unix, OS X) or
          %APPDATA%\monotone\keys\ (Windows).  'db migrate' will
          automatically move your keys out of your database and into
          their proper location.  Consequences:
          - 'genkey' no longer requires a database.  Simply run it
            once when you first start using monotone, even before you
            have created a database.
          - Running 'genkey' once will suffice to give all databases
            on one computer access to your key.  No more fiddling with
            'read'.
          - When you want to make your key available on another
            computer, simply copy over the appropriate file from your
            'keys' directory to the corresponding directory on the new
            computer.
        - Private keys also use a more standard on-disk envelope
          encoding ("PBE-PKCS5v20(SHA-1,TripleDES/CBC)") instead of
          previous ARC4.  More secure, and with extra crypto karma.

        Netsync changes:
        - Command line syntax for 'serve' changed; administrators WILL
          have to adjust scripts.
            monotone serve my.host.com "*"
          becomes
            monotone serve --bind=my.host.com "*"
          or simply
            monotone serve "*"
          (to serve on the default port, on all interfaces).
        - Speaking of which, we can now bind to all interfaces; run
          'serve' without passing --bind, or with passing
          --bind=:port, and monotone will listen on all interfaces.
        - New option '--key-to-push' for 'push', 'sync', allows
          administrator to push a new user's public key into a running
          server without restarting it.
        - Netsync permission hooks have new defaults that read a
          description of allowed access out of a standard,
          basic_io-based textfile (the same stanza-based format that
          revisions use).  Current hooks will continue to work, but
          users may prefer to transition to this format; see manual
          for details.
        - Between these, it is now straightforward to change
          permissions and add users without restarting your server.
        - Improvements to experimental "usher" facility.

        UI improvements:
        - New convenience options "add --unknown", "drop --missing",
          "revert --missing" do what you'd expect -- add all
          non-ignored non-versioned files, drop all
          deleted-but-undropped files, and restore all
          deleted-but-undropped files, respectively.
        - New selector "h:" to select heads of a branch.  "h:" means
          heads of current branch, "h:mybranch" means heads of
          mybranch.
        - Similarly, "b:" selector with no argument now refers to
          current branch.
        - Commit messages now have a blank line at the top so you can
          start typing directly.
        - No more obscure error messages when multiple monotone
          processes attempt to access a single database at the same
          time; we now fail early with a more sensible error message.
          (Concurrent access has never caused database corruption;
          this simply makes the corruption prevention less frustrating
          for the user.)
        - New handlers for SIGTERM, SIGINT to rollback database
          transactions.  Not visible to users (unless you're really
          looking carefully).  (Again, killing monotone has never been
          able to cause database corruption; this simply causes the
          transactions to be rolled back immediately, rather than the
          next time monotone runs, which improves robustness in some
          theoretical way.)

        Changes in 'automate':
        - New command 'automate keys' to get information on existing
          keys in basic_io format.

        Updated translations:
        - fr

        Smaller changes:
        - Improved handling of multibyte characters in message
          displays.
        - Fixes to Botan's memory allocator, to avoid pathological
          slowdowns in some rare cases.
        - Fix bug in delta-storage code; we were not being as aggressive
          about delta-compressing files and manifests as we should
          have been.
        - Minor bugs fixed, error messages improved.

                - Upgrading from 0.23: You must run 'db migrate' and
                  provide your password, for each database.

Fri Sep 30 02:50:05 PDT 2005

        0.23 release.

        Possibly incompatible changes:
        - hook_note_commit and hook_note_netsync_revision_received
          take a new argument containing the text of the revision that
          was received.  (Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>)
        - 'cat FILENAME' now acts like the old 'cat file REV
          FILENAME'; use new commands 'automate get_revision',
          'automate get_manifest', 'automate get_file' to fetch
          objects by hash.  (Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>)

        General improvements:
        - .mt-ignore support (Martin Dvorak
          <jezek2@advel.cz>, Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>)
        - much work on making monotone more i18n friendly (Benoît
          Dejean <benoit@placenet.org>, Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>)
        - support for more interactive merge tools:
          - FileMerge.app (comes with OS X) (Marcel van der Boom
            <marcel@hsdev.com>)
          - TortoiseMerge (Win32; comes with TortoiseSVN) (Matthew
            Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>)
        - rename and drop now actually perform the specified rename or
          deletion when the argument --execute is passed.  (Richard
          Levitte <richard@levitte.org>)
        - 'help' command, same as --help (Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>).
        - 'usher' support: experimental method for proxying multiple
          netsync servers through a single port (similar concept to
          vhosts) (Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>)
        - support long passphrases (Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>)
        - Faster binary file detection (Eric Anderson
          <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>)
        - netsync speedups:
          - when handling large files (Eric Anderson
            <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>)
          - when handling many branches (Marcel van der Boom
            <marcel@hsdev.com>)
        - new system to allow crash logs to contain not just execution
          traces, but also dumps of data being handled when the error
          was detected -- greatly improves debuggability of user
          crashes.
        - complete rework of path handling code, for clarity,
          robustness, and speed.  No user visible changes, except for
          the many bugs fixed.  (Special thanks to Matthew Gregan
          <kinetik@orcon.net.nz> and Grahame Bowland
          <grahame@angrygoats.net>.)
          - however, if you have non-normalized paths in your history
            (symptom: fresh pulls with 0.18 work, but fresh pulls with
            0.19 do not), then 0.23 will report an error and refuse to
            handle the affected revisions.  Since it is believed this
            only affects one project, and to conserve core developer
            time, implementing a migration was put off for now.  If
            this causes problems or for more details, please send an
            email to monotone-devel@nongnu.org.
        - as always, many small bug fixes, speedups, and improved
          messages.

        New translations:

        Other new monotone-related projects since 0.22:
        - mtsh by Timothy Brownawell:
            https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/brownawe/www/mtsh/
          GTK+ wrapper for monotone focusing on working copy
          operations -- add/drop/revert/rename/commit/update/diff and
          browsing.  Has a mechanism for per-file commit comments.

        - "dumb server" support by Nathaniel Smith (share your
          monotone repositories via HTTP/FTP, no netsync daemon
          needed):
            http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net//branch.psp?branch=net.venge.monotone.dumb
          Still needs a command-line frontend to be usable, among
          other things.  Help wanted.  In python.

        - m7 by Larry Hastings <larry@hastings.org>
            http://www.midwinter.com/~lch/programming/m7/
          Experimental drop-in command-line wrapper for monotone.
          Uses certs to add local incrementing version numbers, and an
          enhanced annotate front-end.

Mon Aug  8 23:23:53 PDT 2005

        0.22 release.  new crypto library, bug fixes, ui improvements

        - switch from crypto++ to botan as underlying crypto library.
          this should not cause any user-visible changes; let us know
          if it does.  special thanks to Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>, Kaushik Veeraraghavan
          <kaushikv@gmail.com>, Matthew Gregan
          <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
        - incompatible change to netsync permission hooks: the
          get_netsync_anonymous_read_permitted hook has been removed;
          instead, get_netsync_read_permitted will be called with a
          key name of nil.  server administrators should update/review
          their configuration
        - new option for merge and propagate: --lca.  Until we get a
          long-term solution to the various 3-way merge problems, this
          should be more convenient than using explicit_merge.
        - many small improvements to error messages, fixes of minor
          annoyances, netsync tickers more accurate, etc.

Sun Jul 17 16:48:26 PDT 2005

        0.21 release.  bug fixes, performance improvements, and ui
        improvements.

        - fixes a number of major performance bugs in 0.20's netsync
          implementation.  special thanks to Matt Johnston
          <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
        - fixes a number of major bugs in 0.20's (rewritten)
          cvs_import command.
        - configury kluges to work around g++ 4.0/boost 1.32
          incompatibilities.  special thanks to Christof Petig
          <christof@petig-baender.de>, Matthew Gregan
          <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>, Jordan Breeding
          <jordan.breeding@mac.com>.
        - ui enhancements:
          - new netsync option "--exclude": branches are included if
            they match any of the given globs, unless they match any
            of the given --exclude globs.  special thanks to Timothy
            Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
          - new netsync option client "--set-default": makes it easy
            to change default server/branches.
          - "diff" now takes options "--context" and "--external", to
            output context diffs and to invoke an external diff
            program for full control over output formatting.  new
            option "--diff-args" pass arguments to external diff
            program; new hook "external_diff" allows further
            configuration.  special thanks to Vladimir Vukicevic
            <vladimirv@gmail.com>.
          - b: and t: selectors now match exactly, instead of matching
            as substrings.  globbing is supported for inexact
            matching.  special thanks to Brian Downing
            <bdowning@lavos.net>, Jordan Breeding
            <jordan.breeding@mac.com>.
          - new command 'db kill_tag_locally'.  special thanks to Jordan
            Breeding <jordan.breeding@mac.com>.
        - now uses sqlite3 prepared statements.  special thanks to
          Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - 'db migrate' is now a complete no-op if there is no
          migration to do; automated scripts can now call it
          optimistically and cheaply to guarantee up-to-dateness.
        - new hash correctness tests.  special thanks to Kaushik
          Veeraraghavan <kaushikv@gmail.com>.

                - upgrading from 0.20: you must run 'monotone db
                  migrate' once against each of your databases, to add
                  new sql indexes.

Tue Jul  5 23:57:10 PDT 2005

        0.20 release.  features, ui improvements, performance
        improvements, and bug fixes.

        - major changes in netsync UI: serve/sync/push/pull now take a
          list of globs; clients can request arbitrary sets of
          branches, not just predefined "collections".  write
          permissions are now granted on a per-db level (they were
          before anyway).
                - where you used to say, e.g., "monotone pull
                  net.venge.monotone", you should instead say
                  "monotone pull net.venge.monotone*".  This may
                  require shell-quoting.
                - 'get_netsync_write_permitted' hooks must be changed
                  to take only one argument, the 'identity'.
                  'get_netsync_{read,anonymous_read}_permitted' hooks
                  now take a branch argument instead of a collection,
                  and will be called for each branch that a client
                  requests.
                - 0.19 clients cannot talk to 0.20 servers, and vice-versa.
                - special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
                  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>, Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
        - other major changes:
                - cvs_import re-written; many bugs fixed.  now
                  supports tags.
        - many minor netsync changes:
                - netsync traffic is now cryptographically authenticated
                  against corruption and man-in-the-middle attacks.
                  special thanks to Ethan Blanton <elb@elitists.net>,
                  Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
                - new hooks that are called when server receives data:
                  note_netsync_*_received.  special thanks to Timothy
                  Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
                - ancestry graphs that pass outside the given branch
                  are now synchronized correctly.  special thanks to
                  Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
        - UI improvements:
                - 'log' options changed: --depth has become --last;
                  new options --no-merges, --diffs, --brief.
                - 'status' has new option --brief.  special thanks to
                  Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
                - 'serve' has new option --pid-file.  special thanks
                  to Matthew Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - all commands taking restrictions now take option
                  --depth, to limit recursion through subdirectories.
                  special thanks to Joel Reed <joelwreed@comcast.com>.
                - merge command all take --author, --date now.
                - 'checkout', 'update' take --revision, instead of
                  using positional arguments.  special thanks to Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'commit' takes new --message-file option.
        - new features:
                - new commands: "db kill_branch_locally", "db
                  kill_revision_locally", useful for correcting some
                  mistakes.  special thanks to Brian Campbell
                  <brian.p.campbell@dartmouth.edu>, Sebastian Spaeth
                  <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - new file attribute 'manual_merge', to prevent invocation of
                  merger on binary files.  hook added to guess correct
                  value at 'add' time.  special thanks to Riccardo
                  Ghetta <birrachiara@tin.it>.
                - new 'earlier than', 'later than' selectors.  special
                  thanks to Riccardo Ghetta <birrachiara@tin.it>.
        - new automate commands:
                - 'stdio', for efficient use by
                  front-ends.  special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
                  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
                - 'certs', for fetching certs on a revision in a
                  parseable (basic io-based) format.  special thanks
                  to Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>.
                - 'inventory' output changed incompatibly; should be
                  much more usable now, and stable.  special thanks to
                  Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - better memory/performance when handling large files.
          special thanks to Eric Anderson
          <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>, Timothy Brownawell
          <tbrownaw@gmail.com>, Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
          Matthew Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
        - new text mode browser in contrib/mtbrowse.sh, by Henry
          Nestler <Henry@BigFoot.de>.
        - improved zsh completion in contrib/monotone.zsh_completion,
          by Joel Reed <joelwreed@comcast.com>.

                - upgrading from 0.19: database and working copies are
                  fully compatible.  netsync clients and servers need
                  to be upgraded together, as described above.  the
                  many ui changes may require script updates.

Tue May  3 00:31:37 PDT 2005

        0.19 release.  performance improvements, features, ui
        improvements, and bug fixes.

        - many operations sped up by another factor of 2 or better.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
                - first steps towards automated benchmarking.  Thanks
                  to Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
        - new major features:
                - "annotate" command; still requires optimization.
                  Thanks to Emile Snyder <emile@alumni.reed.edu>.
                - "inodeprints" for fast change detection in large
                  working dirs now fully supported; see manual for
                  details.
        - new minor features:
                - new selector "c:name=value" for selecting on
                  arbitrary certs.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - new hooks to automatically initialize attributes on
                  add; monotone now automatically sets execute bit on
                  executables.  Thanks to Joel Reed
                  <joelwreed@comcast.net>.
                - new automate command "select", to do selector
                  expansion.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - new automate commands "graph", "parents",
                  "children", "ancestors", to easily inspect history.
                  Special thanks to Sebastian Spaeth
                  <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>.
                - new command "db kill_rev_locally".  Thanks to
                  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - new arguments to "commit": --author, --date; useful
                  for patch attribution and importing history.
                - new automate command "inventory" (output format will
                  change in next release, however).  Thanks to Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - ui improvements:
                - netsync progress ticker in kilobytes/megabytes.
                  Thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au> and
                  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - tickers do not cause annoying scrolling when wider
                  than window.  Special thanks to Matthew Gregan
                  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - warn users when a commit creates divergence, and
                  when an update ignores it.  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - support for command-specific options (there is still
                  no rule that such options must appear after the
                  command on the command line, though).  Thanks to
                  Richard Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
        - bug fixes:
                - many cvs_import bugs fixed.  Special thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>, Emile Snyder
                  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>, Hansjoerg Lipp
                  <hjlipp@web.de>, Matthew Gregan
                  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - windows/unix working copy line ending conversion now
                  works correctly.  Thanks to Emile Snyder
                  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>.
                - many fixes to i18n-ized filename support
                - "drop" and "rename" now affect file attributes as
                  well.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org> and Joel Reed
                  <joelwreed@comcast.com>.
                - better error reporting in netsync.  Thanks to
                  Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>.
                - only set working directory's default branch on some
                  commands (update, commit).  Thanks to Florian Weimer
                  <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
                - "db check" now sets exit status correctly, for use
                  in scripts.  Thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - many others...
        - fantastic emacs integration in contrib/monotone.el.  Thanks
          to Harley Gorrell <harley@panix.com>.
        - 45 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~84%.

                - upgrading from 0.18: database and working copies are
                  fully compatible.  NOTE that the configuration file
                  is now ~/.monotone/monotonerc, rather than old
                  ~/.monotonerc.  Simply create ~/.monotone, and
                  rename any existing configuration file.

        0.18 release.  performance improvements, features, and bug fixes.
    This release is dedicated to Shweta Narayan.

        - most operations sped up by a factor of 2 or better; many sped up
      by up several orders of magnitude.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>, Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Linus Torvalds
                  <torvalds@osdl.org>.
        - new concept: "database vars".  Used in several features below.
        - new features:
                - new file "MT/log" can be edited while you work,
                  sets default changelog.  (no change in behaviour if
                  you do not edit it.)  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - monotone now stores default netsync
                  server/collection, initialized on first use of
                  netsync.
                - you no longer need to manually import server
                  keys, monotone will fetch the key from the server on
                  first netsync.
                - monotone keeps track of keys of servers you have
                  previously synced with, to prevent man-in-the-middle
                  attacks.
                - several powerful new "automate" commands added.
        - new command 'ls known', lists files that are under version
          control.  Thanks to Florian Weimer <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
        - preliminary "inodeprints" functionality -- speeds up diff,
          status, etc.  No UI or documentation yet -- in a working
          copy, 'touch MT/inodeprints' to enable, then commit or
          update to populate cache.
        - UI improvements:
                - Added short options -r, -b, -k, -m.
                - default to 'dot' ticker-style when stderr is
                  not a tty, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - New "-@/--xargs" option, helpful when using new
                  automate commands.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - New "--depth" argument to 'log'.  Thanks to Richard
                  Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'db info' gives statistics on space usage.
                - new command 'dropkey'.  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
        - robustness improvement: if monotone crashes in a working
          directory and --dump and --debug were not specified, saves
          debug dump to "MT/debug" for analysis, instead of
          discarding.
        - new contributed scripts: CIA (cia.navi.cx) notification,
          email notification, Bash completion.
        - 33 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~82%.
        - many bug fixes
        - Special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
          for going above and beyond to track down the last
          release blocker.

                - upgrading from 0.17 requires only a 'db migrate'.

Fri Mar 18 15:38:52 PST 2005

        0.17 release. bug fixes and features.

        - many, many robustness improvements
                - more careful checking everywhere
                - much more thorough test suite
                - all revisions subject to careful checks before
                  entering database
                        - not yet fully optimized; "pull" may be very
                          slow and use lots of cpu
                - support for "epochs", to safely manage future
                  rebuilds, hash migration, etc.
                - new "db check" command, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
        - now uses sqlite3, thanks to Christof Petig
          <christof@petig-baender.de>.
                - removes most former size limitations
        - "restrictions" support, thanks to Derek Scherger
          <derek@echologic.com>.
                - most commands now take a list of files to limit
                  their actions to
                - monotone can now be run from anywhere in the working
                  directory (not just the root)
                - new command "monotone setup" required to create a
                  working directory for a new project
        - important security fix -- don't use shell when calling
          external merge commands.
        - format change for "MT/options", ".mt-attrs"; you may have to
          edit these files
                - new command "attr" for managing .mt-attrs.
        - builds merkle tries in-memory -- netsync starts up many
          times faster
        - start of new "automate" interface, for shell scripts and
          others.
        - new command "cdiff": generates context diffs.
        - remove most of now-obsolete manifest/file cert support.
        - 60+ new integration tests.
        - many portability fixes
                - in particular, major win32 cleanups, thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>.  win32 is once again
                  fully and natively supported.
        - many bug fixes

                - several incompatible changes: see file UPGRADE for
                  migration information

Sun Mar 28 12:41:07 EST 2004

    0.11 release. bug fixes and optimizations.

    NOTE: this release expands the sqlite page size. YOU WILL NEED
    to dump existing databases before upgrading and reload it
    after upgrading, otherwise monotone will complain that the
    database image appears malformed. this condition cannot
    unfortunately be distinguished from a real malformed image on
    disk. for example:

        $ monotone --db=my.db db dump >dump.sql
        $ <upgrade to new monotone>
        $ mv my.db my.db.backup
        $ monotone --db=my.db db load <dump.sql

    - fixed bugs:
        - aliasing bug on debian (-O2 now works)
        - netsync ppc portability / checksums
        - sha1 whitespace bug
        - netsync broken formatter
        - broken symlink handling
        - merger execution pessimism
        - LCA bitset calculation pessimism
        - static object initialization order
        - CVS single-version import
        - CVS first-version changelog
        - CVS branch inference and topology
    - cryptographic SSE2 paths enabled on linux/x86.
    - builds against boost 1.31.0.
    - removed boost::socket
    - removed documentation about old networking system.
    - "officially" deprecated old networking system.
    - enable building with system-local libraries.
    - upgraded bundled sqlite.
    - changed sqlite page size from 1k -> 8k

Mon Mar  1 00:32:07 EST 2004
