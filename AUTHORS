main files:
-----------

Graydon Hoare <graydon@pobox.com> originally wrote most of the files
in the top level directory and the OS-specific directories 'unix' and
'win32'.  That's me.

Many of the top level files have subsequently been amended, and new
files added, by other contributing authors, including:

Several people have also contributed to the translation of monotone
into non-English languages; their work is available in the po/
subdirectory.  Contributors include:

  Aristid Breitkreuz <aribrei@arcor.de>

  Stéphane Gimenez <dev@gim.name>
  Thomas Keller <me@thomaskeller.biz>

I believe I am within my rights to assert my own copyright on:

  - the files I wrote

  - the collective work, including the use (though not authorship) of
    files I copied from the public domain, and other copyrighted but
    freely-licensed sources (and possibly lcs.cc, as discussed below)

I license my publication of these copyrighted works to the public
under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2 or greater. See the file
COPYING for details. If you believe I am in violation of some existing
copyrights, please contact me.

Subsequent additions by contributing authors are implicitly licensed
to the public under the same terms (GPL), but the contributing authors
retain copyrights on their portions of the work.

the manual:
-----------

The monotone manual, like the rest of the collective work, was written
by me and the other contributing authors listed above, and is licensed
under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2 or later.

Prior to version 0.38 the monotone manual was licensed under the terms
of the GNU FDL (version 1.1 or later).  This was changed in version
0.38 to facilitate sharing of text between the manual and the program
itself, and to simplify the licensing requirements of the monotone
distribution as a whole, by using just one license for everything.

files derived from other sources:
---------------------------------

Some files included with the monotone distribution began as copies of
code from other sources, but have been modified for use in monotone.
These files all carry attribution notices, and may qualify as
'separate and independent works in themselves' for purposes of the
GPL: that is, if separated from the monotone sources, they may be
usable under less restrictive terms.

lru_writeback_cache.hh was originally written by Patrick Audley and is
licensed under the GPL v2+.

mkstemp.cc was based on a portion of gfileutils.c in glib and is
licensed under the LGPL (version 2 or later).

gettext.h is a copy of the one included in the GNU Gettext package,
and is Copyright (C) 1995-1998, 2000-2002 Free Software Foundation,
Inc.  It is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2 (or later).  For
more information, see the message on top of that file.

unix/main.cc and win32/main.cc were originally execution_monitor.cc
from the Boost project.  The files in the boost/ directory are copies
of files that were at one time available from the boost "sandbox" CVS
repository, linked off of http://www.boost.org/.  monotone also makes
use of several "header-only" Boost libraries (not included in the
source distribution) and therefore the binary incorporates their code.
Boost in general is licensed under the Boost Software License:

The files in boost/ are under a slightly different license:

#  copyright notice.


lcs.cc is a C++ translation of Scheme code written by Aubrey Jaffer.
The original source is under the following license:

#  "differ.scm" O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm.
#  Copyright (C) 2001, 2002, 2003 Aubrey Jaffer
#
#  Permission to copy this software, to modify it, to redistribute it, to

The translation is licensed under the GPL v2+ as the rest of Monotone,
but only if an independent copyright actually exists in the
translation, which was quite mechanical.

ssh_agent.cc includes a translation of the GET_32BIT_MSB_FIRST define
from PuTTY's misc.h. PuTTY is licensed under an MIT-like license,

external libraries:
-------------------

Monotone distributes unmodified or nearly unmodified copies of several
third-party libraries on which it relies.  The binary 'mtn' executable
is a derivative work of these libraries as well as the monotone source
proper, but the monotone developers do not claim copyright in these
libraries (except to the extent that we have personally
contributed code to them).  They are 'separate and independent works
in themselves'.


The files in sqlite/ comprise the SQLite database library, written by
D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com> and others.  The SQLite distribution
may be retrieved from http://www.sqlite.org/.  It is declared to be in
the public domain:

#  The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
#  a legal notice, here is a blessing:
#
#     May you do good and not evil.
#     May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
#     May you share freely, never taking more than you give.


The files in idna/ are copies of the core portion of the GNU libidn
library for manipulating internationalized domain names, written by
Simon Josefsson.  The libidn distribution may be retrieved from
http://josefsson.org/libidn/.  It is licensed under the GNU LGPL
version 2.1 or later, with the additional requirement that the
following text be reproduced in any copies made:

#  Libidn AUTHORS -- Information about the authors.

the contrib directory:
----------------------

The contrib/ directory contains a variety of contributions that may be
useful in conjunction with monotone.  Each file carries its own
copyright statement and licensing; however, to the best of our
collective knowledge, all files are available under terms compatible
with the GPL version 2 (*not* necessarily later versions).  See
contrib/README for further details.

details of the manual relicensing:
----------------------------------

All contributors who made more than a few lines' worth of changes to
the manual were polled for their assent to the relicensing, and as of
November 2007, all agreed.

These contributors gave written agreement on the monotone mailing list
in February 2007:
