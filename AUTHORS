main files:
-----------

Graydon Hoare <graydon@pobox.com> originally wrote most of the files
*.{lua,sql,cc,hh} in the top level directory. That's me.

Three exceptions are the file main.cc, which is a slightly reworked
copy of execution_monitor.cc from the boost project; the file
lru_cache.h, which is a slightly modified copy of a file from Patrick
Audley, and the file mkstemp.cc, which is a slightly reworked copy of
mkstemp code from glib. In both cases I've noted the original
copyrights in the files.

Another possible exception -- depending on how you interpret the word
"wrote" -- is the file lcs.hh, which I did write, but the writing was
merely *translation* (without much inventive contribution) from a file
called differ.scm, from SLIB, which is written by Aubrey Jaffer
<agj@alum.mit.edu>, and on which he retains Copyright. He has licensed
this code for any use provided its copyright notice is preserved,
which it is, in lcs.hh. You can find the original (scheme) code at
http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/

Several of the top level files have subsequently been amended by other
