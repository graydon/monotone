.SH NAME
monotone \- distributed version control system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmonotone\fP \fI[options] <command> [parameters]\fP
.P
Options, which affect global behavior or set default values, come
first in the argument list. A single command must follow, indicating
the operation to perform, followed by parameters which vary depending
on the command.
.SS Note
This manpage is a summary of some of the features and commands of
\fBmonotone\fP, but it is not the most detailed source of information
available. For a complete discussion of the concepts and a tutorial on
its use, please refer to the texinfo manual (via the \fBinfo
monotone\fP command, or online).

.SH DESCRIPTION
Monotone is a version control system, which allows you to keep old
versions of files, as well as special \fImanifest files\fP which
describe the location of files in a tree. Unlike other systems,
versions in monotone are \fIidentified\fP by cryptographic hash, and
operations are authenticated by individual users' evaluating
cryptographic signatures on meta-data, rather than any central
authority.

Monotone keeps a collection of versions in a single-file relational
database. It is essentially serverless, using network servers only as
untrusted communication facilities. A monotone database is a regular
file, which contains all the information needed to extract previous
versions of files, verify signatures, merge and modify versions, and
communicate with network servers.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--help\fP
Print help message.
.TP
\fB--debug\fP
Turn on debugging log on standard error stream. This is very
verbose. Default is to be silent, unless an error occurs, in which
case failure log is dumped.
.TP
\fB--quiet\fP
Turn off normal progress messages.
.TP
\fB--dump=\fP\fI<file>\fP
Dump debugging log to \fIfile\fP on failure.
.TP
\fB--nostd\fP
Do not evaluate "standard" lua hooks compiled into \fBmonotone\fP.
.TP
\fB--norc\fP
Do not load lua hooks from user's \fB~/.monotonerc\fP file.
.TP
\fB--rcfile=\fP\fI<file>\fP
Load extra lua hooks from \fIfile\fP (may be given multiple times).
.TP
\fB--db=\fP\fI<file>\fP
Use database in \fIfile\fP.
.TP
\fB--key=\fP\fI<keyid>\fP
Use \fIkeyid\fP for operations which produce RSA signatures. Default
is inferred from presence of unique private key in database. Can also
be customized on a per-branch basis with hook function 
\fBget_branch_key(branchname)\fP.
.TP
\fB-k\fP \fI<keyid>\fP
An alias for \fB--key=\fP\fI<keyid>\fP
.TP
\fB--branch=\fP\fI<branchname>\fP
Use \fIbranchname\fP for operations on a branch. Default is inferred
in operations on existing branches (commit, update, etc).
.TP
\fB-b\fP \fI<branchname>\fP
An alias for \fB--branch=\fP\fI<branchname>\fP
.TP
\fB--ticket=\fP\fIdot|count\fP
Use the given method to print tickers.  The \fBcount\fP method prints
the count for each ticker on one line, incrementing the numbers in
place, while the \fBdot\fP method prints a continuous string of
characters (like some programs provide a progress line of dots).
The default is \fBcount\fP.
.TP
\fB--revision=\fP\fI<id>\fP
Currently this option only applies to the diff command where it may be
used to compare a working copy with a specific revision or to compare
two specific revisions. It will likely apply to other commands in the
future.
.TP
\fB-r\fP \fI<id>\fP
An alias for \fB--revision=\fP\fI<id>\fP
.TP
\fB--message=\fI<log message>\fP
Use the given message as the changelog when committing a new revision
rather than invoking the log message editor. Currently this option only
applies to the commit command but it may also apply to the comment
command in the future.
.TP
\fB-m \fI<log message>\fP
An alias for \fB--message=\fI<log message>\fP
.TP
\fB--root=\fI<root dir>\fP
Stop the search for a working copy (containing the @file{MT} directory)
at the specified root directory rather than at the physical root of the
filesystem.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\fBEDITOR\fP
Used to edit comments, log messages, etc.
.TP
\fBVISUAL\fP
Used in preference to \fBEDITOR\fP, if set.
.SH FILES
.TP
\fB$HOME/.monotonerc\fP
A lua script, used as a customization file.
.SH NOTES
.IP \(bu
Command line options override environment variables and
settings in lua scripts (such as \fB.monotonerc\fP)
